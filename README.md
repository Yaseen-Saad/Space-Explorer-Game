A simple 3D space exploration game where you pilot a spaceship to visit different space locations.

## How to Play

2. Click "Start" to begin
3. Use these controls to fly around:
   - WASD = Move around
   - E = Go up
   - Shift = Go down
   - Q = Stabilize movement
   - Space = Boost (uses more fuel)
